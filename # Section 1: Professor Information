## Required Textbook & Course Material

**Required:** Modern Database Management (10th, 11th, 12th or 13th Editions), Jeffrey A. Hoffer Mary Prescott, Heikki Topi. Publisher: Addison-Wesley. ISBN: 0136088392 (10th Edition)

Note: Any edition of the Modern Database Management book is acceptable for this class as the reading are exactly the same material. I have included the specific pages for each edition in the weekly syllabus below.

**Required:** The student should have access to a Relational database such as or Microsoft Access on MySQL, to practice some of the assignments.

### Workshop/Homework Assignments

There will be a number of in-class workshops and take-home homework assignments that each student needs to complete. The purpose of the homework assignments (and their preceding workshop exercises) is to give students hands-on experience (both with class and outside class) with data and database development and implementation methods so that students can complete their projects successfully.

### In Class Workshops

Workshops provide an opportunity to practice hands-on and learn to apply the lecture topics. Workshops will be an integral part of the class sessions. Typically, I will introduce and lecture on a database topic and then you apply and practice the application of that topic with professor feedback.

### Homework Assignments

Homework problems will be collected and graded. You are responsible for solving these problems. Homework problems are individual work only. You are not to share your solutions with other students

### Research Paper on Advanced Database or Big Data topic

A paper on advanced Database or Big Data topic is required for individuals taking this class. The students may select from a wide variety of topics in the Database or Big Data areas. The paper could a survey paper on how a specific data approach is applied in a specific industry or global region. The paper could also be on a more technical or method specific topic. I suggest that you pick a topic in the field of Database or Big Data that you are very interested in and utilize the paper to increase your knowledge.

As needed, the Professor will meet with each Graduate student individually throughout the semester to discuss and review the student's topic selection and their progress on the paper.

A short abstract on the topic of the paper should be submitted to the professor by **TBD**. The final paper should be approximately 10 pages, double-spaced including figures and references and will be due on the last day of classes: **TBD**

# Section 3: Course Policies 

## Attendance/Participation

Attendance, although not mandatory, is highly encouraged. Our studies show that there is a strong correlation between attendance and the final grade for the course. Participation will account for 10 % of your final grade.

Considering the compressed nature and relatively short-time frame of the course, the due dates for all work are firm to be fair to all students in the course. Late submissions of any work will be penalized as indicated in the Grading section above unless discussed with the professor in advance and you are experiencing extenuating circumstances. **Homework problems and project deliverables that are more than 2 days late will receive zero credit.**

## Extra-Credit

There are NO extra credit assignments in this course. This is because they do not always provide a fair return for a student's extra work and because they have a tendency to be viewed as work that a student needs to make-up at the last moment in order to obtain a better final grade.

## Code of Conduct

Kogod School of Business at American University expects students to conduct themselves with integrity, civility, and respect in order to maintain the school's reputation for professional excellence. Students are responsible for knowing and acting in accordance with the American University Code of Conduct and the American University Academic Integrity Code, as well as with all policies and guidelines found in the University Bulletin.

All written work submitted in partial fulfillment of course requirements must be the student's own work. If you do work with another student in completing any of the assignments, this must be noted on the assignment or an honor code violation may be in play.

You are encouraged to work together and discuss the material, but work that you turn in must be in your own words. It is not appropriate to hand in work that has been jointly created by you and another student.

**Use of AI**

You are encouraged to use AI tools to support your work. You may use AI for each written assignment when completing each one but always remember that YOU must take responsibility for all work submitted. All work you submit is your own work. Always check any AI output for accuracy and correctness.

If you reference any AI tool in your work you must follow the citation approach required by the class.

**Regarding the use of AI tools on the Final Project**

For the final project, you may use AI to support your work but you must not turn in work that is solely created by AI.

## Statement on American University's Student-Centered Learning Environment

This class is an active learning environment. You are expected to participate actively in each class. Participation means much more than just being in the room during class. You are expected to ask questions, discuss the material with others in the class, and take advantage of my presence in the classroom by asking me questions. Essentially, you are expected to become part of a community of people interested in topics covered in class.

## Policy for Late Work

All course assignments and exams are due as indicated in the syllabus. Unless arrangements are made in advance with the instructor or a documented reason of an extenuating circumstance is given, assignments submitted late will be penalized as indicated in the Grading section above.

## Communication with Faculty

Please feel free to stop by my office at any of the office hours I have posted. There is no appointment needed during these times. If the posted office hours do not work for you, we can arrange a mutually acceptable time for us to meet in person or virtually. Although I get many emails each day, I promise a quick turnaround with my reply. If you have not heard back from me in less than 24 hours, please feel free to contact me again. I have been known to miss the occasional email.

## Instructor Availability

I will be available for consultation either via email or during my office hours. I will be happy to meet outside of these hours if these times do not work for you. Please contact me via email at farmour@american.edu to arrange another time. I will also be available via email before and after each class session.

## Email Guidelines

Except in the case of emergencies, emails sent between 5:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. on weekdays, and on weekends will be returned the next business day.

# Section 4: University & Safety Policies

## Diversity and Inclusion

American University expressly prohibits any form of discriminatory harassment including sexual harassment, dating and domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking. All information shared with me as an instructor in class, assignments, papers, or in-person will be protected by confidentiality. However, I am considered to be a responsible employee and thus I am required to share disclosed information regarding prohibited conduct under Title IX and the AU Community Standards Policy with appropriate university officials. This includes the Title IX Coordinator and the Dean of Students.

Your ability to work is paramount as far as I am concerned, and I will refer you to the resources available for resolving issues that you may wish to discuss. [This referral sheet](https://www.american.edu/ocl/dos/student-support-guide.cfm) outlines services you can contact. For any mental health and wellness concerns I can suggest consultation with [Counseling Center](http://www.american.edu/ocl/counseling/index.cfm) on campus.

## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

Under AU policies, any student who has a documented disability that requires accommodation has a right to request academic accommodations from me. I must provide these accommodations if I receive an accommodation letter from the [Academic Support and Access Center](http://www.american.edu/ocl/asac/) that is written for this particular class. Students should submit the accommodation letter to me as soon as possible - within the first two weeks of classes if at all possible. (Please be aware that I will not be able to offer retroactive accommodations.) If you have a disability that requires accommodation that is not being currently accommodated, please speak to me or to the access center as soon as possible.

## Well-being Resources

AU has a range of resources for students to maintain their wellbeing (e.g., mental health and safety). See [Student Resources.](https://www.american.edu/ocl/dos/student-support-guide.cfm) At the [Counseling Center,](http://www.american.edu/ocl/counseling/) the counseling staff, health professionals, and peer educators provide a safe and confidential environment where you can ask questions, obtain resources, and be heard. You don't have to go through personal struggles alone and you are not expected to do so. The [Care Response Team](http://www.american.edu/ocl/dos/care-response.cfm) offers support for students and is available through the Dean of Students Office. If you are concerned about yourself or a fellow student, please contact the dean of students at 202-885-3300, dos@american.edu or use this link [https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?AmericanUniv&layout_id=1](https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?AmericanUniv&layout_id=1%20).

## Statement on Academic and Health Safety

American University will implement a plan for meeting the needs of all members of our community in the event of an emergency that disrupts normal operations. This plan may alter the traditional schedule and format of classes, assignments and assessments.

In the event of an emergency, American University will implement a plan for meeting the needs of all members of the university community. Should the university be required to close for a period of time, we are committed to ensuring that all aspects of our educational programs will be delivered to our students. These may include altering and extending the duration of the traditional term schedule to complete essential instruction in the traditional format and/or use of distance instructional methods. Specific strategies will vary from class to class, depending on the format of the course and the timing of the emergency. Faculty will communicate class-specific information to students via AU e-mail and Blackboard, while students must inform their faculty immediately of any absence. Students are responsible for checking their AU e-mail regularly and keeping themselves informed of emergencies. In the event of an emergency, students should refer to the AU Student Portal, the AU Web site (http://www.american.edu/emergency/) and the AU information line at (202) 885-1100 for general university-wide information, as well as contact their faculty and/or respective dean's office for course and school/ college-specific information.

# Section 5: American University & Kogod School of Business Information

## Academic Integrity Code

Please carefully review the [American University's Academic Integrity Code](http://www.american.edu/academics/integrity/code.cfm). The staff of the [Writing Center](http://www.american.edu/cas/writing/), the [Center for Business Communications](http://www.american.edu/kogod/bizcomm/avoiding_plagiarism.cfm) and the [University Library](http://www.american.edu/library/index.cfm) include experts who can help you learn about how to avoid plagiarism, in particular.

Students are bound by the University's Academic Integrity Code, which ensures that all work done in pursuit of a degree whether graded or ungraded, formal or informal, meets the highest standards of academic honesty. The baseline sanction for a first-time offense for graduate students violating the code is suspension from the university, although academic dismissal is also a common sanction. Suspension and academic dismissal are permanently recorded on the transcript as a violation of the [Academic Integrity Code](http://www.american.edu/academics/integrity/).

## Student Conduct Code

To achieve its ends, an academic community requires the knowledge, integrity, and decency of its members. In turn, the community helps individuals develop habits and values that will enable them to pursue personal satisfaction and to contribute to a better world. This Student Conduct Code is designed to benefit the American University community and to assist in forming the highest standards of ethics and morals among its members. It fosters the university's commitment to excellence and equity and affirms the shared values that make community life possible. Students with alleged violations of the [Student Conduct Code](http://www.american.edu/ocl/sccrs/upload/AU-Student-Conduct-Code.pdf) should contact [Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution Services](http://www.american.edu/ocl/sccrs/index.cfm) to receive further information on disciplinary procedures.

## Computing & Copyright Policy

This policy prohibits individuals from accessing or attempting to access any account, file, and/or software for which they do not have specific authorization.

All AU faculty, staff, and registered students are given computing and network access privileges. Each person is assigned a computer account code (user ID or user name) that provides access to university computing resources and systems for instructional, research, and administrative purposes. Access to these resources is a privilege, not a right. Resources include networks, laboratory systems, residence hall systems, library systems, faculty and staff office systems, and software licensed by the university or its agents for use on university systems.

Because the entire AU community relies upon computing resources and systems to use and store important and confidential data, including software and computer programs, it is morally wrong and strictly prohibited for individuals to access or attempt to access or view any account, file, and/or software for which they do not have specific authorization. Also, it is prohibited to disrupt, delay, endanger, or expose someone's work or university operations.
